# Requirement Specifications

This document outlines the requirements for the MA-POCA implementation for RLlib.

## Functional Requirements

-   **Multi-Agent Training**: The system must be able to train multiple agents simultaneously in a PettingZoo environment.
-   **MA-POCA Algorithm**: The system must implement the MA-POCA algorithm with a self-attention based centralized critic.
-   **Experiment Tracking**: The system must log training metrics to MLflow for analysis and visualization.
-   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The system must support hyperparameter tuning using Ray Tune.

## Non-Functional Requirements

-   **Performance**: The system must be able to train efficiently on multi-core CPUs and GPUs.
-   **Scalability**: The system must scale to handle larger multi-agent environments with more agents.
-   **Reliability**: The system must handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
-   **Maintainability**: The codebase should follow Python best practices and be well-documented.
